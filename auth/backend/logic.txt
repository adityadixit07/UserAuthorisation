--------------------REGISTER----------------

Weâ€™ll be implementing these two routes in our application. We will be using JWT to sign the credentials and bycrypt to encrypt the password before storing them in our database.

From the /register route, we will:

    Get user input.
    Validate user input.
    Validate if the user already exists.
    Encrypt the user password.
    Create a user in our database.
    And finally, create a signed JWT token.


---------------LOGIN---------------

For the /login route, we will:

    Get user input.
    Validate user input.
    Validate if the user exists.
    Verify user password against the password we saved earlier in our database.
    And finally, create a signed JWT token.
